## Questions for Mau Kerja Assessment

1. What kind of architecture did you use?
I am using Bloc architechture in the project and MVC + S design pattern in the project where I split the project to several folder such as repository, model, and networking stuff.

2. What libraries did you add to the app? What are they used for? if you not rely the other library tell us why?
Here is libraries that I used in the project along with its function:
- bloc: Design pattern to help separate business logic from presentation layer and can reuse back the code more efficiently
- flutter_bloc: Flutter Widgets that make it easy to implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern. Build to be used with bloc state management package
- intl: Library that define default locale and methods for accessing most of internationalization mechanism. Generally, I used this when it involves DateTime functions
- dio: This library I used for handling HTTP client. It can supports interceptor, Global Configuration and much more
- flutter_dotenv: Used this library to load configuration from .env file. I used .env since I breakdown the project to 3 flavors that is development, staging and production
- freezed: This library basically is a code generator where I used it in bloc to shorten line of code. Sometimes when implementing states in bloc_states it can takeup few lines.
- freezed_annotation: This package is needed when I used freezed package because it acts as annotations. This package does nothing if there is no freezed package implement
- animated_splash_screen: I used this library to implement easiest way to create animated splash screen that comes with customizable way
- url_launcher: I used this plugin for launch URL which I used to redirect user to Whatsapp or mailbox
- flutter_easyloading: This plugin is used for loading widget which does not use any context at all
- bloc_test: Testing library which make it easy to test blocs
- build_runner: This library used to build system if there is any dart code generator and modular. For this project, this library used to run freezed and json_serializable
- json_serializable: Auto generate code for converting to and from JSON by annotate Dart class. It can be used in model class
- json_annotation: Classes and helper function that support JSON code generator which relate with json_serializable package
- mocktail: A Dart mock library which simplifies mocking with null safety support and no manual mocks or code generator
- very_good_analysis: This is a package where it provides lint rules for Dart and Flutter which are used and generated automatically with very_good_cli

3. How long did you spend on the test?
I used three days in completing the test

4. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would like to implement a little bit of unit test in the projects. Besides that, if I had more time I would like to add related blog features which I can used up tag response from the API to show related blogs when user entering blog detail screen

5. Which parts of your submission are you most proud of? And why? little advice, dont answer whole project, use one what you think it special.
For me, I am most proud of where I split the projects into few folders and files. My code looks neat and structured and I think it is very easy to understand when people read it.

6. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I spend most of the time in making search feature. For me, search feature for this project required me to handle with two list that is blog and candidate

7. How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them, please elaborate more about this.
Overally, I am really enjoy doing the assessment given. It was a good test for Flutter Developer. My opinion, everyone can code and make it happen but what I try to strive is a neat and very easy to understand code. Besides that, I am suggesting a way to improve more on candidate API. Currently, I faced a little bit of confusion where I need to show candidate details but I need to match candidate API with email API, Address API and status API by ID. I think it will be best if the API can return example as 'https://private-b9a758-candidattest.apiary-mock.com/{candidate_id}. This API can be trigger when user click to view candidate detail by only passing the ID to the API.

8. The last question, quality or quantity?
I choose quality over quantity. For me, a good quality of code can lead to many good things such as improve developer experience, easy to understand when newcomer coming and give much more beneficial things. Quality is not something that can achieve easily. I am also still digging more and more to achieve clean and very understandable code. I define programming as a drawing. To draw a picture, we can draw it with any method that we can but our aim is only one to complete the drawing. 




## Getting Started üöÄ

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Mau Kerja Assessment works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:mau_kerja_assessment/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```
